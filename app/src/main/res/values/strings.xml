    <string name="zakat_info">A Zakat calculator in Islam is a tool that helps Muslims determine the amount of Zakat (obligatory almsgiving) they are required to pay based on their wealth and assets. Zakat is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is obligatory for eligible Muslims who meet the minimum wealth threshold (Nisab). The calculation typically involves assessing various types of assets and deducting liabilities to arrive at the Zakatable amount \n\n Here\'s a general guide on how Zakat is calculated: \n\n Nisab: Determine whether you possess wealth above the Nisab threshold. Nisab is the minimum amount of wealth a Muslim must have before being obligated to pay Zakat. It is based on the value of gold or silver. \n\n Eligible Assets: Identify the types of assets that are subject to Zakat. Common Zakatable assets include savings, investments, gold, silver, business inventory, and agricultural produce \n\n Liabilities: Subtract any outstanding debts and liabilities from your total assets. Zakat is calculated on the net wealth after deducting debts.</string>

    <string name="booksPdf_detail">The Muwaṭṭa, also known as Muwatta Imam Malik, stands as a seminal work in the realm of Islamic jurisprudence and hadith literature. Compiled by the revered scholar Imam Malik ibn Anas in the 8th century, it remains one of the earliest and most comprehensive collections of hadith texts, seamlessly integrating the disciplines of hadith and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). \n\n Imam Malik, born in the city of Medina in 711 CE, received his early education in the cradle of Islam, gaining profound insights into the traditions and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Renowned for his piety, scholarship, and deep knowledge, Imam Malik became one of the leading jurists and hadith scholars of his time. \n\n The Muwaṭṭa, meaning Well-Trodden Path" or Beaten Track, reflects Imam Malik's commitment to preserving and transmitting the prophetic traditions. Completed around the year 798 CE, this monumental work is divided into several books, covering a wide array of topics, including ritual worship, ethics, family law, and commercial transactions. Its organization is thematic, making it accessible and practical for both scholars and the general public.</string>
    <string name="scholar_detail">Imam Al-Ghazali, born Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali, was a highly influential Islamic scholar, philosopher, and theologian who lived during the 11th century. His contributions to Islamic thought have left an enduring impac. \n\n Al-Ghazali was born in 1058 in Tus, a city in present-day Iran. His early education consisted of studying traditional Islamic sciences, and he quickly distinguished himself as a brilliant student. He later became a professor at the Nizamiyya College in Baghdad, one of the most prestigious institutions of learning in the Islamic world. \n\n One of Al-Ghazalis most significant intellectual journeys was his exploration of skepticism and doubt. Facing a personal crisis and questioning the certainty of knowledge, he embarked on a quest for truth and certainty. This introspective period led him to write his autobiographical work, Deliverance from Error, where he described his struggles and ultimate return to a deeper understanding of Islamic faith.</string>
    <string name="inheritance_law">Quranic Basis: The rules of inheritance are primarily derived from specific verses in the Quran, particularly from Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4), which provides detailed guidance on the distribution of wealth after a persons death \n\n Fixed Shares: In Islam, the shares of the heirs are predetermined and fixed. The Quran specifies the shares for close relatives like spouses, children, parents, and sometimes siblings. \n\n Spousal Share: The surviving spouse is entitled to a share of the inheritance. The share depends on whether there are children or other heirs. In the absence of children, the spouse may receive a larger share. \n\n Childrens Shares: Children, including sons and daughters, have fixed shares. Sons usually receive double the share of daughters. If there are no direct descendants, other relatives may inherit \n\n Parents Shares: Parents are entitled to inherit from their childrens estate, especially in the absence of direct descendants.</string>
